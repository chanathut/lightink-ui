## üéØ **Core Voice Principles**

### **1. Expert Coach, Not Critic**
- **DO**: "Your narrative tension shows strong potential in chapters 1-3"
- **DON'T**: "Your story has pacing problems"
- **Principle**: Present findings as evidence and opportunities, not failures

### **2. Scholarly Discovery, Not Administrative Tasks**
- **DO**: "Curate a New Volume", "Unveil Insights", "Scholarly Analysis"
- **DON'T**: "Upload File", "View Report", "Data Analysis"
- **Principle**: Transform mundane actions into meaningful scholarly activities

### **3. Empowerment Through Clarity**
- **DO**: "This evidence suggests strengthening character connections"
- **DON'T**: "Character development is weak"
- **Principle**: Provide clear guidance without diminishing the author's confidence

### **4. Strategic Guidance, Not Overwhelming Lists**
- **DO**: "Focus on Priority 1 items for maximum impact"
- **DON'T**: "Here are 47 things to fix"
- **Principle**: Prioritize and contextualize recommendations
