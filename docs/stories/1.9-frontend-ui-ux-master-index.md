   - Establishes design foundation
   - Creates reusable components
   - Sets up animation system basics

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)
2. **Story 1.9b**: Upload Flow & Payment Interface
   - Implements core user journey
   - Integrates with existing backend systems
   - Ensures secure payment processing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
3. **Story 1.9c**: Report Dashboard & Data Visualization
   - Creates the main value proposition
   - Integrates with all backend analysis systems
   - Provides professional report viewing experience

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Week 4)
4. **Story 1.9d**: Animation System & Responsive Design
   - Enhances user experience with animations
   - Ensures perfect responsive design
   - Achieves full accessibility compliance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Animation Performance**: Implement performance monitoring and reduced motion support
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize for mobile devices with progressive enhancement
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Have fallback designs for external libraries
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Test on all major browsers and devices

### Timeline Risks
- **Story Dependencies**: Ensure proper sequencing and dependency management
- **Complex Visualizations**: Start with simple charts, enhance progressively
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Use automated testing tools and manual verification
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor Core Web Vitals throughout development

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test all components with accessibility checks
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete user flows end-to-end
- **Visual Testing**: Test responsive design across all breakpoints
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and animation performance
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing

### Definition of Done
Each story is considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Tests pass with > 90% coverage
- Accessibility compliance is verified
- Performance benchmarks are achieved
- User experience is validated

## Success Metrics

### Overall Project Success
- **Complete User Journey**: Seamless experience from landing to report
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals in green across all pages
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- **User Satisfaction**: High usability scores and low error rates
- **Technical Quality**: Clean, maintainable code with good test coverage

### Individual Story Success
Each story has specific, measurable success criteria defined in its respective document, ensuring clear expectations and accountability.

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve**: Review all sub-stories for completeness and clarity
2. **Prioritize Development**: Begin with Story 1.9a as the foundation
3. **Set Up Development Environment**: Ensure all tools and dependencies are ready
4. **Establish Testing Framework**: Set up automated testing and quality gates
5. **Begin Implementation**: Start with Story 1.9a and progress sequentially
