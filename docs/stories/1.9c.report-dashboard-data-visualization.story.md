## Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: Core infrastructure and API endpoints ✅
- **Story 1.4**: Analysis orchestration and job management ✅
- **Story 1.5**: AI analysis modules (Pacing, Character, Prose, Thematic) ✅
- **Story 1.6**: Revision roadmap generation ✅
- **Story 1.7**: Report dashboard data visualization (backend) ✅
- **Story 1.8**: PDF report export backend ✅
- **Story 1.9a**: Design system (for consistent styling)
- **Story 1.9b**: Upload flow (for user journey completion)

## Success Metrics
- **Report Load Time**: < 3 seconds for full report display
- **Visualization Performance**: 60fps smooth interactions
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Perfect display on all mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score > 95%
