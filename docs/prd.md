### **Lightink Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

#### **Goals and Background Context**

##### **Goals**

* Establish Market Entry by successfully launching the Lightink MVP.  
* Achieve Revenue Validation by generating $75,000 within six months post-launch.  
* Validate the effectiveness of the tiered "Free Analysis", "Pro Analysis", and "Premium Workshop" subscription pricing model.  
* Prove Technological Adaptability by generating a Proof of Concept analysis for one B2B vertical.

##### **Background Context**

Lightink 1.0 is a web-based manuscript diagnostic tool designed to solve the "analysis paralysis" that "Serious Authors" face. The current market offers a difficult choice between prohibitively expensive human editors and unreliable beta readers. Lightink bridges this gap by providing the clarity of a professional developmental editor through an actionable, data-driven "Revision Roadmap" at an accessible price, empowering authors to elevate their work with confidence.

### **Requirements (Revised)**

#### **Functional**

1. **FR1:** The system must allow a user to securely upload a manuscript in .docx format.  
2. **FR2:** Upon file selection, the system must perform a client-side "pre-flight check" to display the manuscript's word count before final upload.  
3. **FR3:** The manuscript analysis process must run asynchronously in the background.  
4. **FR4:** The system must collect a user's email address before starting the analysis.  
5. **FR5:** The system must offer three distinct analysis tiers: a free "Free Analysis" tier, a "Pro Analysis" subscription tier, and a "Premium Workshop" subscription tier.  
6. **FR6:** The system must securely process payments before initiating the analysis scan.  
7. **FR7:** The system must generate an interactive, web-based dashboard to display the analysis results.  
8. **FR8:** Upon analysis completion, the system must send an email to the user containing a secure, time-limited link to their report dashboard.  
9. **FR9:** The dashboard must include visualizations for Pacing (Heatmap), Character Interactions (Web), Prose & Dialogue patterns, and Thematic Resonance.  
10. **FR10:** The system must use an external LLM to generate a prioritized, actionable "Revision Roadmap" based on the full analysis.  
11. **FR11:** The system must allow the user to export the complete analysis report and Revision Roadmap as a single, formatted PDF document.

#### **Non-Functional**

1. **NFR1:** The application must be a responsive web app, providing a usable report-viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.  
2. **NFR2:** The analysis for a standard 80,000-word manuscript must be completed in under 10 minutes.  
3. **NFR3:** All user data, especially the manuscript content, must be handled with end-to-end encryption and be permanently deleted from servers after the analysis is complete and the report has been delivered.  
4. **NFR4:** All API calls to the external LLM must be optimized to ensure cost-efficiency.  
5. **NFR5:** The MVP will be session-based; it will not require or support user accounts or the server-side storage of user reports beyond the secure link's expiry.  
6. **NFR6:** The backend architecture must be modular to support the long-term vision of a real-time "Story Co-pilot."

### **User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience must feel professional, secure, and empowering, transforming the anxiety of revision into a process of discovery. The design theme is "The Digital Athenaeum"â€”a modern, clean, and focused digital library or data visualization studio. The UI should prioritize clarity and reduce cognitive load at every step.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **The Handshake:** The upload process will be a guided, reassuring experience that builds trust through clear communication and visual feedback (e.g., the "vault" animation).  
* **The Case File:** The analysis dashboard will be an interactive, non-judgmental discovery tool. Data is presented as "evidence" and "clues" for the author to investigate, not as errors to be fixed.  
* **The Game Plan:** The Revision Roadmap will be presented as a strategic, goal-oriented plan from an expert coach, focusing on enhancement and empowerment.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

* Upload Screen  
* Payment Modal  
* Analysis In-Progress Screen  
* Report Dashboard (Tabbed Interface)  
* Revision Roadmap View

#### **Accessibility**

* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA

#### **Branding**

## ** Color Palette**
**Primary**: Charcoal (#2D3748) and Payne's Gray (#4A5568) for trust and professionalism
**Warmth**: Vanilla (#FFF4AF) for encouraging, warm backgrounds
**Energy**: Tangerine (#ED8936) for calls-to-action and important highlights
**Clean**: Azure (#F5FFFE) for fresh, uncluttered backgrounds

## **ðŸŽ¨ Visual Style**
- **Sophisticated Cartoon**: Clean, playful elements with professional color usage
- **Delightful Interactions**: Subtle animations that make the experience fun
- **Whimsical Icons**: Lucide React icons with your color palette
- **Smooth Animations**: 300ms ease-out transitions with playful micro-interactions

 **Typography:** A clean font (e.g., Inter) for UI/body, paired with an elegant and minimal and bold serif (e.g., inter) for major headings.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**

* **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive

### **Technical Assumptions**

#### **Repository Structure**

* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo.  
* **Rationale:** To simplify dependency management and code sharing for a small, focused team.

#### **Service Architecture**

* **Service Architecture:** Serverless Functions / Microservices-lite.  
* **Rationale:** To align with the long-term "Story Co-pilot" vision, requiring a modular, scalable, and cost-efficient analysis engine.

#### **Testing Requirements**

* **Testing Requirements:** Unit \+ Integration.  
* **Rationale:** To maintain a rapid development pace for the MVP, focusing on core module and service integration correctness.

#### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

* The system must include an abstraction layer for the external LLM API to allow for switching providers.  
* The system must include a secure mechanism for handling the user's email address and generating a time-limited, single-use secure link for the report.

### **Epic List**

#### **Epic 1: Core Manuscript Analysis MVP**

**Epic Goal:** To create a functional, end-to-end web application that allows a "Serious Author" to securely upload a manuscript, purchase an analysis, receive a comprehensive report via a secure link, and download that report as a PDF. This epic delivers the complete core value proposition of Lightink 1.0.
